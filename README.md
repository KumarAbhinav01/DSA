This repository contains all of my progress while learning DS. I have tried to note down as much information as possible and I hope it will benifit others. My goal behind this project was making it a complete open source and believe you will also contribute to this documentation and share your knowledge. This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. You can check out the website live [here.](dsa-abhi6722.vercel.app)

## Contribution

While contributing to this repository you first need to install its dependencies and trust me working and editing this repository is realy simple and fun.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

It uses markdown so you can add and edit contents in markdown so for details visit [here.](https://dsa-abhi6722.vercel.app/docs/intro#)
